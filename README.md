# Pool_epitech
All my work during the 1-month pool at Epitech Lyon.


The work is composed of :   - 12 days of exercises
                            - 2 rush ( 1 week-end project with someone )
                            - the Infinadd ( infinite addition ), The EvalExpr ( Priorities ) and the Bistro-matric ( Infinite  + - * / % , priorities,
all base. That was a project of 2 weeks with 2 people)

The 12 days are not 100% succesfull, do not take them as granted.
The 2 rush are 100%.
The infindadd is 30%, the EvalExpr 60% and the Bistro 100%.
